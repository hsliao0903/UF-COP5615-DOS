* implementation of concurrent, distributed applications
* Akka
  * a toolkit and runtime
  * on JVM
  * written in Scala
  * Actor model
    * Everything is an actor (object)
    * designed to serve as a concurrent model
    * message passing
      * share information with one another
    * Akka creates a layer between __the actors__ and __the underlying system__
      * actors simply need to process messages
    * *Reactive application*
      * event-driven
        * handles requests asynchronously 
      * scalable
